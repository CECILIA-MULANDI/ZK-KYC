## Privacy-Preserving KYC Verification with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

This project aims to provide a system for KYC verification using Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology, ensuring user privacy and data security.

## Introduction

In a world increasingly concerned about data privacy, the need for privacy-preserving identity verification systems is crucial. This project leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure KYC processes that allow users to prove their identity or meet requirements without exposing sensitive information.

## Features

    Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Verifies user information while maintaining confidentiality.

    Modular ZK Library: A reusable tool for developers to integrate ZK-based KYC in their apps.

    End-to-End Platform: Provides a dashboard for organizations to verify user KYC.

    Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports integrations across various systems.

    Rust and Succinct.xyz: Built using Rust for efficiency and uses Succinct.xyz for ZK proof generation.
